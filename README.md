## Install

I did it twice, choose one.

The Zig is faster I think and produces a smaller binary.

### Go

Clone the repo and run with `go`:

    git clone https://github.com/braheezy/underfire
    cd underfire/go
    go run main.go

To exit, click/focus the fire and press `Esc`.

### Zig

Clone the repo and run with `zig`:

    git clone https://github.com/braheezy/underfire
    cd underfire/zig
    zig build run
